## Notes

Part2 was pretty cool, and not terribly difficult.  

My initial solution was rejected by the server, so I tried `V` instead of `U`...also rejected.  Then I finally noticed I accidentally had a `"` in the response, so removed that, STILL rejected! Modified it back to my original character of `U` and that worked :facepalm:
